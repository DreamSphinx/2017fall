## Eric Whaley's 'Introduce Yourself' Assignment

I’m currently in my last semester of the Computer Science program, so I have bits of experience in a few different things. My main programming language that I’m most comfortable with is Java, as the main CS courses focus mainly on that. I also have a bit of experience with C from my Assembly class, as well as using it with Flex and Bison during my Compiler Design course. I’ve also played around a little bit with C# in Unity, but I don’t really have enough experience in it to be comfortable with using it. Lastly, I’m hoping to become better with CSS/HTML, as I don’t really have much experience in it (I’m working with a friend to help learn it).

I’m hoping to use these skills we learn in this class in order to hopefully get a job in web development. My dream job would be making gaming apps or games in general, which would usually require a website in order to give details about them. However, looking more realistically, I would just be happy in learning how to make a well designed website in general, as a lot of employers seemed to be looking for those kinds of skills in general when I went to the job fair last semester. One of my friends also has his own personal website with his resume information too, which I thought was pretty cool, so I was hoping I’d be able to gain the skills in order to make an in-depth site about myself if possible.
